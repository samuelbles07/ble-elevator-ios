## IOS app to control elevator

NOTE:

Apps only connect to elevator when range is under 3 meters. [See code](https://github.com/samuelbles07/ble-elevator-ios/blob/main/ElevatorButton/BLEManager.swift#L63)

#### TODO

- [X] BLE Handler
- [X] Create real UI
- [X] Connect by RSSI constrain
- [X] Handle disconnect and reconnect
- [X] Label app status (Connected, elevator not found, elevator found please get closer, bluetooth off)
